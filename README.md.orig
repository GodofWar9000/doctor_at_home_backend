# Doctor@Home: Backend repository

*Doctor@Home supports clinicians to closely monitor their Covid-19 patients that are confined at home.
It reduces workload from Clinicians and supports the medical triage. Helps optimize scarce clinical resources while reducing infection exposure for patients and clinicians. It improves patients quality of life by being able to stay home with their family as long as medically justifiable*

=======
* Run "docker-compose up --build" to build images and start container
>>>>>>> dev/docker-compose

* Run "docker-compose up -d" to run docker containers in detached mode

* Go to <http://localhost:8080/pathhere> to access endpoints

* Run "docker-compose stop" to stop containers

* *Note: Remember to change url addresses used in application.properties if server address changes*

* *if localhost doesnâ€™t work, then you can check ip address of containers by running "docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' $(docker ps -q)"*

## Testing

* Jwt is used for authenticating each request

* A POST request to the JWT Authentication endpoint must be sent to receive a bearer token to authenticate all requests to the API endpoints

* Using the Swagger UI, you can add the bearer token to all requests by  clicking the padlock icon and giving in the token, in form "Bearer replace_token_string_here"
